# SnapBattle
## Introduction
SnapBattle is an innovative mobile application designed to keep friend groups connected through the fun and engaging activity of photo-sharing based on daily prompts. Developed as a project for CS307: Software Engineering I, SnapBattle breaks down the challenge of maintaining close friendships in the middle of the distractions of broader social media platforms.

## Features

- **Private Groups:** Users can create private groups where only members can view and interact with each other‚Äôs posts, allowing a safe space for sharing.
- **Private Group Messaging:**: Within each group, members can send messages, reply, and view updates, keeping everyone connected and engaged.
- **Daily and Weekly Contests:** Users participate in daily votes to choose the best photo-prompt combination, with winners earning leaderboard points. Weekly votes consider only daily winners, giving more competition to the application.
